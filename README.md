This project is a web-based application designed for the Malaysian government agency, PERHILITAN MALAYSIA. 
It will automate the permit and license issuance process for wildlife trade, facilitating efficient management

- **Main Goal**: to enhance performance by transitioning from the old system, which is written in PHP, to the new system built on the .NET Framework,
  specifically ASP.NET MVC. This transition aims to provide new functionality, making it easier and more efficient for users to complete their tasks.

- Module Verification and Validation : Focuses on functions involving Information Reviewer and Approver Officers at the Entry Point for the purpose of importing, exporting, and re-exporting. It encompasses tasks related to verifying and validating data entries, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and compliance with regulations. Additionally, the module facilitates the review and approval process, streamlining verification tasks and enhancing data integrity.

- Module Reporting : Focuses on visualizing the report more attractively using Power BI.

## Technology Stack

- **ASP.NET MVC Version**: The project is built using ASP.NET MVC 5.2.

- **Database Management System**: The project uses SQL Server (MSSQL) as the backend database management system

- **MSSQL Version**: The project is developed and tested with SQL Server 2016

- **SQL Client**: DBeaver is used for experimenting with SQL queries and managing the database schema.

- **Power BI**: Providing interactive dashboards and reports to visualize insights from the data stored in the SQL Server database.

## My Contributions

In these modules, my contributions have included:

- Users can perform better Verification and Validation tasks, as the new system improves data consistency and includes validation checks, ensuring accurate data input and enabling edit functions.
- Create a Global Function that retrieves and displays all relevant information based on a License. This function can be reused by other developers as needed
- Implement a search function across all modules of the system.
